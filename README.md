# Bank-Employees-Churn-Modelling-

The dataset is the details of the customers in a company.
The column are about it's estimated salary, age, sex, etc. Aiming to provide all details about an employee.

Based upon data of employees of a bank we calculate whether a employee stands a chance to stay in the company or not.

To begin with, a rigorous Exploratory Data Analysis is performed in which data is cleaned and preprocessed, removing all the outlers, standardizing the dataset, and so on.

After EDA, the dataset is modelled using different Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier.

After this, an extensive hyperparameter tuning is done using Grid Search CV to increase the accuracy sccore andto achieve the best accuracy score.
